# Deciphering the Californian Dreamscape: Data-Driven Insights into Housing Market Dynamics
## Overview
The project analyzes California's housing prices using the 1990 California Census data. The dataset contains 20,640 observations with various features like location, median income, and housing characteristics. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships between housing prices and other factors, such as proximity to the ocean, household income, and geographical features, to assist real estate developers, investors, and policymakers in making informed decisions.

The project involves extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the use of models like linear regression, logistic regression, and clustering to predict housing prices. Key insights include the positive correlation between median income and housing prices, as well as the influence of proximity to the coast. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting California's housing market, offering data-driven insights to guide strategic investments and policy decisionsâ€‹
